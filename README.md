# Hi there 👋, I'm Luis
## Full-stack Web Developer 🚀
### About Me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [ClickGreen](https://www.clickgreenapp.com/)
- 👀 I'm interested in web3 development 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Solidity and Rust
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects
- 
I'm passionate about full-stack web development and dedicated to creating interactive and dynamic web pages using different tools and frameworks. On the front-end, I use React.js to create graphical interfaces and reactive components that allow effective interactions with users. I also have experience with Next.js to enhance the efficiency and scalability of my applications.

Regarding mobile development, I've worked with React Native to create mobile applications that offer smooth and responsive experiences across multiple platforms.

In the back-end realm, I've collaborated on projects using Express and MongoDB to build robust APIs and efficient databases that support my applications' functionality. I've also worked with Django and FastAPI in Python, as well as Node.js in JavaScript.

My curiosity about the world of data science and artificial intelligence continues to grow. I've always considered myself a perpetual student, with a curious mindset and a desire to understand the "why" behind things. Additionally, I'm a university student majoring in Astronomy, and I enjoy delving into the universe and its unresolved mysteries.

When I'm not working on web development projects or learning about data science and AI, I immerse myself in reading, studying, and contributing to the Web2 and Web3 development communities. I'm passionate about helping and sharing knowledge, and I'm always seeking ways to enhance my skills and knowledge in the world of technology. Additionally, I've collaborated on Web3 projects, using Solidity to create smart contracts and integrating them on the front-end to provide decentralized and secure experiences.
